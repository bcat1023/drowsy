                <article><span class="tab"></span>Hi there, before we get started its best for you to know that everything your about to read is generated by ChatGPT 3.5, My vision of AI is for it to become a tool for humans to assist and make our lives easier, however AI should not be a replacement for humans, You can get the same results by asking ChatGPT to interview you then create a biography and make it sound like your speaking to the audience. The following text below is an experiment to demonstrate ChatGPT capabilities.</article>

                <article><span class="tab"></span>Hello there! My name is Drowsy and I'm a full-stack web developer. I love building servers that serve content and creating beautiful UIs that provide the best user experience. I've worked on projects ranging from game sites to influencer websites. However, my biggest challenge has always been coming up with the vision of what I want to create.</article>
                <br>
                <article><span class="tab"></span>Whenever I run into a challenge, I find inspiration from other websites to create ideas for my own projects. I focus a lot on creating responsive designs that change depending on the users' needs and ensuring the UI/UX is optimal.</article>
                <br>
                <article><span class="tab"></span>I have some experience with React and Vue but prefer to use HTML, JS, and CSS as they simplify things and make them run smoother and faster. Currently, I'm really interested in front-end design.</article>
                <br>
                <article><span class="tab"></span>I occasionally use GIMP to design graphics for my websites and I'm getting more and more familiar with it slowly over time.</article>
                <br>
                <article><span class="tab"></span>The way I first got into this field was by discovering HTML files on an old Sony VAIO that contained the Sony support site. I opened the files in Notepad and started messing with things making the site do whatever I wanted it to do. Later, I discovered W3Schools, which I followed to learn and create my own websites.</article>
                <br>
                <article><span class="tab"></span>I try to optimize my websites to minimize loading times. I use file compression and minimization, fast CDNs, and minimize requests and file sizes before compression to maximize efficiency.</article>
                <br>
                <article><span class="tab"></span>I actively use Google PageSpeed to make sure my websites are always running at optimal speeds. Overall, I'm passionate about web development and always looking for new ways to improve my skills and create better websites for users.</article>
